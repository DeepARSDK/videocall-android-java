This example demonstrates how to use DeepAR SDK to add face filters and masks to your video call using [Agora](https://www.agora.io/) video calling SDK

To run the example

* Go to https://developer.deepar.ai, sign up, create the project and the Android app, copy the license key and paste it to MainActivity.java (instead of your_license_key_goes_here string)
* Download the SDK from https://developer.deepar.ai and copy the deepar.aar into videocall-android-java/deepar
* Sign up on [Agora](https://www.agora.io/), get the App Id.
* In MainActivity.java, replace your_agora_app_id_here with your agora app id
* Run the app on 2 devices and start the call on both of them. The remote views should appear on both devices.
